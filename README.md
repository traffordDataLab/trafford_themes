# trafford_themes

A dashboard application visualising themes relating to Trafford Council's priorities. The [Corporate Plan](https://www.trafford.gov.uk/about-your-council/strategies-plans-and-policies/Corporate-Plan.aspx) describes the council's strategic vision, outcomes and priorities for the borough. The themes relate to the priorities and other important areas of work undertaken by the council.

Within the themes are a range of indicators. These show data for Trafford compared to the average of other similar Local Authorities (in terms of statistical characteristics) and also, where possible, to England. Similar Local Authorities for indicators relating to children are defined within the [Children's Services Statistical Neighbour Benchmarking Tool](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-interactive-tool-lait). For all other indicators the [CIPFA Nearest Neighbours](https://www.cipfa.org/services/cipfastats/nearest-neighbour-model) or [NHS England Near Neighbour Peer Group](https://github.com/NHSDigital/ASC_LA_Peer_Groups) are used as appropriate.
