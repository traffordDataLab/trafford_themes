#### Average Progress 8 score 

Progress 8 aims to capture the progress that pupils in a school make from the end of primary school to the end of key stage 4 (KS4). The greater the Progress 8 score, the greater the progress made by the pupil compared to the average for pupils with similar prior attainment.

Years shown are academic years. Data for 2019/20 and 2020/21 not avalable, due to exam cancellation because of COVID-19.
