#### Total prescribed long acting reversible contraception (LARC) excluding injections rate / 1,000.

Rate of total number of implants, intra-uterine system (IUS) and intrauterine device (IUD) excluding injections prescribed by GP and Sexual and Reproductive Health Services per 1,000 resident female population aged 15-44 years

An increase in the provision of LARC is a proxy measure for wider access to the range of possible contraceptive methods and should also lead to a reduction in rates of unintended pregnancy.
